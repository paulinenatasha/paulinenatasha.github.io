            1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
            with the experience?
          </p>
          <p id="answer1" class="answer">
            The first thing that caught my attention was the 3D graphics, which
            highlighted different sections of the interface. When I hovered over
            these graphics, they responded to my mouse movements, where several
            elements moved, and popup text followed my cursor. This made it
            clear that certain parts of the interface were interactive. I then
            noticed other touchable elements that reacted to my mouse, with a
            circle showing my movements getting larger, indicating that more
            elements were interactable. After this, I saw a prompt that said,
            "Scroll to explore the Luniverse" at the bottom of the homepage.
            When I scrolled, the 3D elements began floating, leading me to the
            next page. These interactive 3D elements were key in drawing me into
            the experience. Additionally, the minimalist design, clean layout,
            and calming color scheme of the homepage also stood out, making the
            interface both engaging and visually appealing.

          <p id="answer1" class="answer">
            The part of the Luni.app experience where I spent the most time was
            with the 3D interactive elements on the homepage. These elements
            were not only visually attractive but also responded to my actions,
            keeping me engaged. Their movement and feedback when I hovered over
            them made me want to explore more and see how each one reacted to
            different actions. This part of the experience felt especially
            immersive, creating a sense of discovery as I uncovered new features
            with each interaction. The time I spent with these elements was the
            most engaging part of the experience, setting the tone for how I
            interacted with the rest of the website.

          <p id="answer1" class="answer">
            The most common action during my two-minute interaction with the
            Luni.app website was hovering over different interactive elements to
            observe their responses. This included not only the 3D graphics on
            the homepage but also the navigation bar at the top of the page.
            Each time I hovered over an element, whether it was a graphic or a
            navigation section, there was visual feedback, such as movement,
            popup text, or preview images. This consistent feedback reinforced
            the idea that the site was designed to be explored through active
            interaction, keeping me engaged throughout the experience.

          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            My impression of the main goal of the Luni.app experience is to
            immerse users in a lively and visually appealing environment that
            encourages exploration. The 3D graphics, interactive elements, and
            responsive design show that the site wants to capture users'
            attention and guide them through its content in an engaging and
            intuitive way. The interactivity isn't just for show - it's a key
            part of the experience. This makes it clear that the site is
            designed to keep users interested and make exploring the content
            enjoyable and memorable.

          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            The Luni.app experience shows its main goal through responsive
            design and visual cues that guide how you interact. When you first
            see the homepage, the 3D graphics and hover effects grab your
            attention, showing that this isn't just a site to look at. The
            website uses prompts like "Scroll to explore the Luniverse" to
            encourage you to take action. As you interact, elements move and
            respond, keeping you engaged. This approach clearly shows that the
            website is meant to be explored and interacted with, not just
            viewed, making for a more immersive and engaging experience.

          </p>
          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            I feel that the Luni.app experience is meant for short, repeated
            interactions over time. The interactive elements, dynamic visuals,
            and content layout suggest that users are encouraged to explore the
            site gradually, coming back to find new features or content with
            each visit. The navigation bar, with its preview images, indicates
            that there's always more to discover, keeping the site fresh and
            engaging even after several visits. Overall, the experience seems
            designed for users to engage in short bursts, exploring different
            parts of the site each time.

            The Luni.app experience shows how to interact with it through its
            design and layout, which encourage exploration. The interactive
            elements and prompts guide you to take certain actions. The
            navigation bar with preview images hints that there's always more to
            discover. The way the site gradually reveals content and responds to
            your actions suggests that the experience is meant to unfold over
            several visits. This approach makes you want to come back and
            explore more each time, creating a feeling of ongoing discovery and
            engagement.

          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            The Luni.app experience draws from digital media like video games,
            interactive installations, and virtual reality. The 3D graphics and
            interactive elements are similar to what you'd find in video games,
            where your actions change the environment. The site's immersive
            quality and visual feedback are like interactive installations or
            virtual reality, where the experience is designed to be engaging and
            exploratory. These features make the site feel more like an
            interactive digital experience than a traditional website.

            The references to video games, interactive installations, and
            virtual reality suggest I should approach Luni.app with a spirit of
            exploration. Like in a game or VR environment, I'm encouraged to
            interact and discover new things on the site. This means I should
            try different interactions, see how elements respond when I hover
            over them, and explore the content at my own pace. My actions will
            shape my experience on the site, so I should be ready to experiment
            and engage actively with what I find.

          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            These references suggest that I should feel curious, engaged, and
            even a sense of wonder when using the Luni.app website. The
            interactivity and dynamic responses are meant to create a feeling of
            discovery, similar to exploring a new level in a video game or
            moving through a virtual world. This approach helps users feel
            immersed in the experience, fostering a connection with the content
            that goes beyond just watching. The goal seems to be for users to
            feel excited about exploring the site, discovering new features, and
            enjoying the interaction process.

          </p>
          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            The most frustrating part of the interaction is when too many things
            respond at once. If lots of 3D graphics, popups, and other elements
            react to my actions at the same time, it's hard to focus on one
            thing or know what's important. This can be confusing and make the
            experience less enjoyable. It becomes difficult to use the site
            effectively when there's too much happening. While interactivity is
            good, it needs to be balanced so it doesn't overwhelm the user.

          </p>
          <p id="answer2" class="answer">
            The most satisfying part of the interaction is how smooth and
            responsive the 3D elements are. Their movements and immediate
            feedback based on my actions make the experience feel intuitive and
            rewarding. Each interaction feels meaningful, and the visual
            responses show that the site reacts to my presence. This level of
            interactivity enhances the user experience, making it both engaging
            and enjoyable. I feel satisfied knowing that my actions have a
            direct and visible effect on the interface, creating a sense of
            control and immersion.
