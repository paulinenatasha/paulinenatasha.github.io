<!-- For this assignment, I focused on a single action, which was click. My goal was to highlight the simplicity of interaction and the minimalist design in my web game.
 I followed a YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooru4pyEv1I), experimented and made adjustments to the code to align it perfectly with my vision for this project.
 Additionally, I added background music to enhance the immersive experience for users.-->
