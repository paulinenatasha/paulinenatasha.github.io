            The main objective of Echoscape was to develop an interactive
            digital soundscape that invites users to playfully and spatially
            explore and engage with audio. In addition to being a creative tool,
            I wanted the project to be a meditative experience where users could
            immerse themselves in sound and try out various aesthetics with
            changing background colors and audio components. My ultimate goal
            was for Echoscape to encourage curiosity, offer a feeling of
            exploration, and provide a relaxing multisensory experience instead
            of just passive listening.

            Beyond novelty, I prioritized accessibility and emotional impact. In
            order to ensure that users of all ages and technical skill levels
            could enjoy Echoscape, it was important that it is accessible for
            everyone and that no prior experience is needed. I also wanted the
            project to evoke a sense of calmness, relaxation, and wonder,
            providing users with a gentle escape. Accessibility, ease of use,
            and emotional impact were all the core values that guided the
            project's development.

            To prevent overwhelming users with too many options, I intentionally
            kept the design space to simple functionality and a minimalist
            aesthetic while still incorporating ambient audio. This decision was
            made to maximize accessibility and ensure a welcoming experience for
            everyone. Conceptually, I aimed to create ambient, peaceful
            soundscapes using echo in tone.js, avoiding loud or overly
            complicated audio elements to maintain a consistent and calming
            environment.

            For the visual style, I selected a minimalist and calming aesthetic,
            using a soft color palette and fluid animations. The intention was
            to create a visually soothing environment based on the themes that
            complemented the ambient audio. I mainly focused on using gradients
            for the relaxing background and growing shapes to match the echo
            audio. In addition, I included several themes to provide users with
            a variety of spaces that they may enjoy. I had originally intended
            to create a blooming flower shape in the garden theme. However, due
            to time constraints, I decided to use the ellipse shape instead, as
            it appeared to represent a petal or leaf-like shape.

            There were several decisions and alterations I made regarding the
            technical aspects of the project. I used Konva.js for the visuals,
            including the creation and animation of shapes, and Tone.js for the
            audio functionality. I adjusted the timing of the growing circles to
            be longer so they would better match the audio. For the sound, I
            originally used the built-in synth from Tone.js, but it didnâ€™t sound
            like what I was aiming for. I then sourced some audio samples from
            Pixabay, which I implemented with Tone.js, allowing me to pitch the
            notes up or down as needed. To give users more options to explore, I
            also repositioned the notes from the Y axis to the X axis.

            When creating echoscape, I stick with a minimalistic and relaxing
            layout and experience. I carefully balanced each element, creating a
            multisensory experience with calming visuals and soothing audio.
            This balance was achieved by designing intuitive controls that
            invite experimentation without overwhelming the user. The end result
            is a project that feels cohesive and thoughtfully designed, with
            each component contributing to the overall atmosphere. Nevertheless,
            one element didn't function as planned. At one point, I decided to
            reduce the background volume so that the instrument notes weren't
            overpowered and everything was balanced. However, it turned out that
            it was too quiet, and users could no longer hear it clearly. I will
            make the necessary adjustments and incorporate them into future
            changes.

            During the project's development, I prioritized the simple layout,
            graphics, and audio elements before adding other features like the
            volume and theme picker. I also made sure to design a
            straightforward and user-friendly interface for the users, ensuring
            that they do not feel overwhelmed and instead experience the sense
            of calm and tranquility that I am aiming for. Once all of the
            essential features were functioning correctly, I focused on
            experimenting with colors and added additional components to my
            project.
