          4. What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
          conventions?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Wigglypaint includes drawing tools with a range of brushes, eraser
          tools, color palettes, canvas clearing, and the option to export and
          crop the canvas, all of which align with digital painter conventions.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h3>5. What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h3>
        <h4>
          Wigglypaint adds new elements to the digital painting genre, such as
          interactive sound feedback and a wiggly animation effect, which makes
          it more engaging and kid-friendly. Additionally, the integration of
          Decker in Wigglypaint also allows users to access and modify the code
          and design a whole new layout, where users can program their own
          interactive platform using the provided code and tools, which
          encourages experimentation.

          6. What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be
          added?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Looking through the features provided, there are several standard
          elements that are lacking, including layers and zoom capabilities.
          Ideally, a larger option of color palettes and an additional set of
          brushes could also be added to increase creative possibilities.

          7. What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
          indicates this?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          The target audience for Wigglypaint appears to be artistic individuals
          who enjoy creating digital art in a casual and playful medium,
          allowing them to express their unique style, particularly those who
          love quirky doodles and fanart. Wigglypaint's playful interface,
          user-friendly design, and special features like wiggly animations and
          sound feedback make it enjoyable and approachable for a diverse range

          8. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Due to its limited tools provided, Wigglypaint can become slightly
          restrictive, and it felt quite repetitive over some time, which might
          not be as engaging. Furthermore, even though we can turn the sound
          off, it can be somewhat annoying after a while.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h3>9. What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
        <h4>
          The simplicity and straightforwardness of the program allow me to
          create random and fun doodles with no thought given to it. The
          animation of the wiggly lines and sound feedback also make it more
          engaging and enjoyable when I first interact with it.
